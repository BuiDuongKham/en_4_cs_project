<h1>English for Computer Science Final Project</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>What is this project about?</h3>
<p>This project is a website that uses Tensorflow JS to collect data, train and predict real-time thanks to the combination of BaseModel MobileNetv3 and your own data</p>
<h3>Who did this project?</h3>
<p>Bui Duong Kham, a student of Faculty of CS at Phenikaa University</p>
<h2>The Usage:</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Clone this project</h3>
<h3>Step 2: Open the web page</h3>
<div>
<p>Open the index.html file in your browser. It's likely to look like this:</p>
<img src = "assets/open.png" alt = ""/>
</div>
<div>
<p>After loading completely, your web page looks like this. You can enter any name of class which you need to classify in the form then click "Save" </p>
<img src = "assets/form.png" alt = ""/>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Then, click the "Enable Webcam", the web page will ask you to allow the web page to use your camera.Of course, you need to click "Allow" to continue</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>After that, you can see the video from your camera and 2 buttons named after 2 classname you entered above. Press and hold on each to start collecting data for each class</p>
    <img src = "assets/class1.png" alt = ""/>
    <img src = "assets/class2.png" alt = ""/>
</div>

<h3>Step 3: Train the model</h3>
<p>Just click on a button named "Train and predict" and be patient because the training progress could last a bit long</p>

<h3>Step 4: Enjoy</h3>
<p>After the training progress is done, you can see the result of the prediction. The result is the class which has the highest probability</p>

<img src = "assets/predict2.PNG" alt = ""/>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading this README file. Hope you enjoy this project</p>
